# Problem 2:
# Within this stead-state simulation model, we can represent a real-life situation where we can obtain many observations
# and apply the Law of Large Numbers.
# In this case, we have 1000 games. If one repeats the set of games many times to construct a very large number of
# independent 100(1âˆ’alpha) confidence intervals, each based on observations, the proportion of these confidence intervals
# that cover the unknown but true mean is expected to be 1 - alpha. We call this proportion the coverage of
# the confidence interval.
#
# Problem 3:
# In case of casino owner who gets to play this game many times:
# The confidence intervals for the expected rewards is [-31.79297649475803, -20.007023505241968] and the expected
# losses is [0.5766762814896707, 0.6373237185103293]. The true mean of expected rewards and losses should fall into
# those intervals with 95% confidence. These CI shows evidence of the casino owner not paying out a lot to the gamblers
# and thus not losing out a lot of money.
#
# A gambler who gets to plays this game only 10 times:
# This is a transient-state simulation model which represents a real-life situation where the number of
# observations is too small to apply the Law of Large Numbers to make inference about E[x], or the estimate.
# As such, we are more interested in the distribution of X rather than only E[x]. With a transient-state simulation,
# we report the projection intervals. For this simulation, our projection intervals are
# [-135.73676311196448, -4.263236888035507], showing evidence of the the gambler losing money and falling within
# negative projection intervals.
